## 📝 My Story

I am Yohannes, an IT expert with a true love for technology. From a young age, I was fascinated by how computers and software evolve. This curiosity led me to study **Computer Science** at **Bonga University**, where I developed a strong foundation in IT support and troubleshooting.

Despite my university not teaching programming languages like Python, my enthusiasm for tech motivated me to teach myself and pursue online certifications. One of the key programs I completed was the **Google IT Support Professional Program**, which deepened my technical knowledge and fueled my passion for the constantly evolving tech industry.

My diverse skill set helped me secure a role as an **IT Officer** at the **Ethiopian Overseas Employment Agencies Federation**, where I applied my knowledge to troubleshoot and ensure smooth IT operations. But, it was when I discovered mobile app testing that I found my true calling.

I transitioned into a **Mobile Application Tester** role at **Forward Logistics Technologies**, where I apply critical thinking and attention to detail to improve mobile app quality. Even though I’ve only been in this field for a month, my excitement for mobile technology continues to grow.

In my free time, I stay up to date with the latest tech trends and actively seek new educational opportunities to further expand my skills.
