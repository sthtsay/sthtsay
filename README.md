## About Me

Iâ€™m an IT expert with a lifelong passion for technology. From a young age, I was fascinated by the rapid growth of computers and software, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science from **Bonga University**. Since then, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience working as an IT Officer, Mobile Application Tester, and now as a Quality Assurance Professional.

My journey in tech has involved everything from managing IT support systems to leading mobile application testing teams. Iâ€™m particularly interested in improving user experiences and ensuring that technology meets high-quality standards. Outside of work, I constantly stay updated on the latest trends in technology and continue learning through online courses and certifications.
